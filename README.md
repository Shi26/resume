# resume

A single-column XeTeX resume template with lots of breathing room

## Installation

There are no releases yet for this project.

## Usage

This package provides a class file and a .xtx template filled with lipsum. You
can change the content in the template to suit your needs, and/or use the class
definition elsewhere to get similar formatting capabilities.

## Dependencies

To build files using this template, you will need XeTeX and LaTeX2e.

This resume template uses the
[Muli](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Muli?selection.family=Muli) and [PT
Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Sans?selection.family=PT+Sans)
typefaces, redistributed under the Open Font License. A copy of the Open Font
License (labeled 'OFL.txt') can be found within each typeface's directory in
the /resources/fonts subdirectory.

## Acknowledgement

The organization, design, and contents of this package were based in
large part on the
[Deedy-Resume template](https://github.com/deedy/Deedy-Resume). The starter
contents for both the TeX template and the .cls file were based on the
OpenFont variation of the Deedy-Resume template.
